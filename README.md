# ‚ùì About

Economica is an **Economy Bot** made by *Science Done Right*. Economica includes the regular banking features like withdrawing and depositing cash. Robbing, and more.
Economica also includes a LOT of customisation for most features.

A bot dashboard will be made when the bot gets some serious attention.

## Prefix

The default prefix is `coin` (with a space at the end.) Users can also use `coin.` as a valid prefix.

In the future per-server prefixes will be added.
Please check `commands.md` for all commands.

# üì¨ Release Info

We currently have *no deadlines or expectations* for the bot to become popular. But anyways, expect the bot to be released at **around October** (Not considering any factors that can influence the development).

Anyways, the bot will take a lot of time and love to be made into a really fun economy bot.
