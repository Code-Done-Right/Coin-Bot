# ‚ùì About

Economica is an **Economy Bot** made by *Science Done Right*. Economica includes the regular banking features like withdrawing and depositing cash. Robbing, and more.
Economica also includes a LOT of customisation for most features.

A bot dashboard will be made when the bot gets some serious attention.

## Prefix

The default prefix is `coin `  (with a space at the end.) Users can also use `coin.` as a valid prefix.

In the future per-server prefixes will be added.

## Features

### Moderation

Aside from the normal commands like warning, muting, kicking and banning users, we also have a special, optional command, called jailing.

Basically, jailed users can only read the #rules channel (which must be spceified while configuring the jail command) in the server. Nothing else. They are free to leave the server and can rejoin without the jail role.

Use `coin jail config` to configure the jail command.
Use `coin jail <@user/ user id> (reason)` to jail the user.

**All moderation commands:**

`coin warn <user>` : Warns the user. 3 warns lead to a mute of duration 2 hours.
`coin mute <user> <duration> (reason)` : Mutes the user for duration (please specify in one letter, for example 1s, 2h, 3d, etc).
`coin kick <user> (reason)` : Kicks the specified user.
`coin ban <user> (reason)` : Bans the user from the guild.

# üì¨ Release Info

We currently have *no deadlines or expectations* for the bot to become popular. But anyways, expect the bot to be released at **around October** (Not considering any factors that can influence the development).

Anyways, the bot will take a lot of time and love to be made into a really fun economy bot.
