# ‚ùì About

Economica is an **Economy Bot** made by *Science Done Right* Using `hikari` and `hikari-lightbulb`. Economica includes the regular banking features like withdrawing and depositing cash. Robbing, and more.
Economica also includes a LOT of customisation for most features.

**NOTE:** Economica is intended to work only on Python x3.x.x +. The bot does not work properly with Python v2.x.x.

## Prefix

The default prefix is `coin` (with a space at the end.) Users can also use `coin.` as a valid prefix.
We will prioritize on slash commands though, since discord plans to move all bots to use slash commands only.
